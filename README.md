# Unity Simple Texture Utility
Create a mask map from textures or values and flip green channel on normal maps. It works for HDRP or URP (just plug the mask map into the metallic texture, Unity will drop the green and blue channel). You can find the tool under "Window > Simple Texture Utility".

## Important

Make sure all textures are the same size, the texture type is set to Default, and the Read/Write flag is checked.
